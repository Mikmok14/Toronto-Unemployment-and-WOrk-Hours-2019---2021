During the emergency, schools were closed, all non-essential travel was restricted and all non-essential commerce was shut-down.  As a result the TTC has been negatively affected and at its lowest point, ridership was down -85% and revenues down -87% per week. Starting in mid-May the Province, while still under a state of emergency, began to re-open certain segments of the economy. For the safety of both TTC customers and staff, various new guidelines like social distancing will restrict full ridership and revenue recovery for TTC until a more permanent solution like a vaccine is available."

During the emergency, schools were closed, all non-essential travel was restricted and all non-essential commerce was shut-down.  As a result the TTC has been negatively affected and at its lowest point, ridership was down -85% and revenues down -87% per week. Starting in mid-May the Province, while still under a state of emergency, began to re-open certain segments of the economy. For the safety of both TTC customers and staff, various new guidelines like social distancing will restrict full ridership and revenue recovery for TTC until a more permanent solution like a vaccine is available."

During the emergency, schools were closed, all non-essential travel was restricted and all non-essential commerce was shut-down.  As a result the TTC has been negatively affected and at its lowest point, ridership was down -85% and revenues down -87% per week. Starting in mid-May the Province, while still under a state of emergency, began to re-open certain segments of the economy. For the safety of both TTC customers and staff, various new guidelines like social distancing will restrict full ridership and revenue recovery for TTC until a more permanent solution like a vaccine is available."

Following a review to improve the accuracy of centralized waiting list data, the City now reports on active applications only. Figures before 2017 also include applications that had inactive status. This change can result in significant changes following a mass update to the status of applications, as can be seen in Q2 2019 when a large number of applications were reviewed and moved from active to inactive status. As a result, the active waiting list dropped from 102,049 at the end of Q1 to 78,796 by the end of Q2."
